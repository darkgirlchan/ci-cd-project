# ci-cd-project Documentation

## Usage Manual

### Project Overview
This project implements a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment processes for a Python-based application. The setup supports efficient version management, automated testing, and streamlined deployment.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher installed on your local system
- Git installed
- A GitHub account

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Make sure all project dependencies are installed by running:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:  
   Once dependencies are installed, execute the main application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Run Tests**:  
   To validate the application, you can run the automated tests as follows:

   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover tests
   ```

5. **Usage Guide**:  
   - **Accessing the Main Features**: Open the application and follow the UI prompts to navigate.
   - **Testing CI/CD Pipeline**: Commit any changes to the main branch, and GitHub Actions will trigger the pipeline to run automated tests and report success or failure.

## Technical Specification: Maintenance, Upgrade, Debug, and Repair Manual

## Project Structure

ci-cd-project/
├── app/
│   └── main.py            # Main application code with add function
├── tests/
│   └── test_main.py       # Unit tests for add function
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── ci.yml         # GitHub Actions workflow configuration

### Maintenance Procedures

1. **Updating Dependencies**:  
   Periodically update dependencies by modifying the `requirements.txt` file as necessary and run:
   
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   ```

2. **CI/CD Workflow Adjustments**:  
   For modifications to the CI/CD pipeline, edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to add or adjust steps.
   Test the modified workflow by pushing changes to a test branch.

### Debugging

1. **Common Issues**:  
   - **Dependency Errors**: If a package fails to install, check for compatibility with the current Python version or update to a compatible version.
   - **Test Failures**: Run individual tests with verbose output for more detailed error messages:
   
     ```bash
     python -m unittest discover tests -v
     ```

2. **Logging and Error Tracking**:  
   - Add print statements or logging in the code to monitor variable states and program flow.
   - For GitHub Actions errors, review the **Actions** tab in the GitHub repository to examine logs.

### Upgrade Procedures

1. **Feature Updates**:  
   For feature upgrades, create a new branch, implement the feature, and test locally.  
   Submit a pull request to integrate changes into the main branch once verified.

2. **Pipeline Upgrades**:  
   Integrate new CI/CD steps by editing `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, including new actions or environments as necessary.

### Repair Guidelines

1. **Fixing Broken Pipelines**:  
   Review GitHub Actions logs for any failing step.  
   Update the `ci.yml` file as needed to address issues, such as outdated dependencies or incorrect paths.

2. **Dependency Conflicts**:  
   For conflicts, verify compatibility versions in `requirements.txt`.  
   Run `pip check` to identify conflicts between installed packages.
